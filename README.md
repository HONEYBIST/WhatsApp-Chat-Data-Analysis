# WhatsApp-Chat-Data-Analysis
# Introduction
WhatsApp is one of the most used messenger applications today with more than 2 billion users worldwide. It was found that more than 65 billion messages are sent on WhatsApp daily, so we can use WhatsApp chat for analyzing our chat with a friend, customer, or a group of people. In this project, we will analyze WhatsApp Chat Data and Sentiment using Python. We will look for the:
1. Overall frequency of total messages on the group.

2. Top 10 most active days.

3. Top 10 active users on the group (with a twist - Most active user had the least average message length ).

4. Top 10 users most sent media.

5. Most active hours and weekdays.

Heatmaps of weekdays and months.

#  How do I export my conversations? From Where To Obtain Data?
I have collected data from Internet,but we can do our own whatsapp chat data analysis.
* The first step is Data Retrieval & Preprocessing, that is to gather the data. WhatsApp allows you to export your chats through a .txt format.
* Go to the respective chat, which you want to export!
* Tap on options, click on More, and Export Chat.

# Importing Necessary Libraries
We will be using :

* Regex (re) to extract and manipulate strings based on specific patterns.
* Datetime Format
* pandas for analysis.
* matlotlib and seaborn for visualization.
* counter: allows you to count the items in an iterable list.
